  ## Description
  One of the most important aspects of programming is writing code that is readable, reliable, and maintainable. Oftentimes, how we design our code is just as important as the code itself. The idea here is to build a Node CLI that takes in information about employees and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person.

  All you need to do is to run `npm install` in the command line in order to install the required dependencies for this app on your system. In order to run this app please type and execute `node app.js` in the command line.

  ## Usage

  This app is a software engineering team generator command line application. The application will prompt the user(manager) for information about the team manager(themselves) and then information about the team members. The user can input any number of team members, and they may be a mix of engineers and interns. When the user has completed building the team, the application will create an HTML file that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on the information provided by the user. You can watch a video walkthrough of how this application works [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZXwV1RQseJ2WDnkgZIMC3H5-tgHsmTZ8/view). Here are also some screenshots of the app:
